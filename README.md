# Ball OS

A simple bootsector OS witch do bounce a simple ball. (That's it...)

## Compile and Run

Get NASM for compiling and QEMU or any other virtual envionement if you want to run it.

*Or you can use your computer but I really don't recommend it...*

Then do:

```
make
```

And if you want to run in a virtual envionement do:

```
make run
```

***If you get any issues please verify that the executables in the `Makefile` is correct.***
